# New Figure Algorithm 
New greedy algorithm for TSP problem is on development state.<br>
#### Brief explanation on NFA algorithm:
1. Create first figure from any combination of points <br>
2. Find nearest to figure point and merge it <br>
3. If any points left then go to step 2 else finish <br>
So you got the main idea, now there are a lot of possibilities how to use it. <br>
In the given example I used idea with set of perimeters and their different combinations. <br>
Better explanation and other information will be available later.. <br>
#### Pros:
- very high speed of calculations
- high flexibility (you can easily combine it with your ideas)
- able to find near optimal solutions
#### Cons:
- didn't find optimal solutions.. yet..
